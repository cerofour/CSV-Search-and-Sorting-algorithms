# Coding guidelines

## Classes

- A class should only do ONE thing and do it efficiently.
- Exceptions make code awful, so always encapsulate usages
of functions that throw exceptions to make it more readable.

## Variables

- All variables should be initialized EXPLICITLY, never leave any
variable IMPLICITLY initialized because that may lead to bugs.
